# April-Suarnaba
I am a 1st Year student at WVSU under the course of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science

 I like to read poems, novels, manga, and webtoons.
 I also love listening to music, especially pop-punks and slow indies.
 I love to support underrated artists. However, I am not good at singing. 
 
 I write poems. I love to watch American series, Korean dramas, movies, and many more.
 I love crime documentaries. Also, I am obsessed in working out and making my body strong, healthy, and fit.
